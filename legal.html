<h1>our legal statement</h1>

<p>We operate in full compliance with legal requirements and BSD regulations. Our official legal entity is "The Ball, Williams, and Scurry Company," which uses the trade name "Boosts and Bites" exclusively for advertising purposes. Our income is below the legal threshold of $14,600, meaning we are not obligated to pay taxes at this time.

    As we are within the first 30 days of operation, we are not yet required to obtain official food safety licensing under Oregon law. However, we adhere to all safety practices outlined in the state's guidelines.
    
    All assets used for advertising and on our website are free to use and non-copyrighted, ensuring we are not in violation of copyright law.
    
    In terms of school policies, we do not sell drugs, alcohol, or drug paraphernalia, nor have we ever engaged in such activities. We are fully transparent, and all company information, including our practices, is available upon request. this is due to the impracticality of listing every asset and conversation on our website, and thus we are not in violation of Code 23.
    
    No technology is officially used for transactions. While our pre-order system and website utilize district-approved technology, all payments are made in person with cash, meaning no technology is involved in the financial transaction process.
    
    We operate during lunch hours and do not disrupt or interrupt other activities, ensuring we are in compliance with Code 10.
